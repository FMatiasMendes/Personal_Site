				Hi there! I’m Filipe. I have experience as a construction project manager, where I developed strong skills in overseeing projects and leading teams. Recently, I decided to transition into programming and web development, driven by my passion for learning and a desire to embrace new challenges.
				<br><br>

				When I’m not working, you can find me playing guitar, enjoying sports, or spending time with friends. I believe in balancing work and play, and I'm always eager to explore new interests and expand my knowledge.
				<br><br>

				As a calm and enjoyable person, I thrive in collaborative environments and love fostering a positive team spirit. I’m excited about this new journey and look forward to connecting with others in the tech community!

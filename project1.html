			<h3>FINAL COURSE PROJECT</h3>
			<p class="generic_text">
				As part of the Full Stack Web Development course that I've did at Codemaster, I had the opportunity to create a comprehensive website for a fictional construction company. This project served as my final assessment and involved adhering to guidelines provided by the web design department to ensure a professional and user-friendly outcome.
				<br><br>
				The website features a clean and modern design, showcasing various projects and services offered by the construction company. A key component of this project was the development of a back office site, allowing the client to update site information, add news articles, and manage new projects effortlessly.
				<br><br>
				For the frontend, I utilized HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript to create a responsive and visually appealing user experience. The backend was developed using PHP with MySQL as the database solution to manage all dynamic content efficiently.
				<br><br>
				This project not only honed my technical skills but also taught me the importance of user experience and client communication in web development. I am proud of the final product and excited to apply what I learned to future projects!

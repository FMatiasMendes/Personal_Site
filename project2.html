			<h3>FINAL COURSE PROJECT</h3>
			<p class="generic_text">
				This website is a personal project designed to expand my knowledge and skills as a developer. It was created to assist with stock management, allowing users to view detailed information about the products in stock, including their name, price, and quantity. Users can also register new products, record purchases and sales, edit product details, and delete products. The site features a secure login system to manage access.
				<br><br>
				The project was developed primarily using PHP, with HTML, CSS and MySQL contributing to its functionality and design.
				<br><br>
				You can test the site using the link below, but please use it responsiblyâ€”any changes made to the products will be visible to the next user.
